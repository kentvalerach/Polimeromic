# Polimeromics Dashboard Project

## 📋 Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analysis and visualization pipeline for polymeromics research. It includes:
- **Big Data Processing**: Handling large datasets (~25 GB) related to polymeromics.
- **Machine Learning Models**: XGBoost and Neural Networks for predictions.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built with Dash to explore data, visualize results, and perform predictions.

The goal of this project is to showcase advanced data analysis techniques and their practical applications in scientific research.
